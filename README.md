# Sem4TypescriptProject

This is Zack and Caspers semester project in typescript fullstack

## Project Description

The project will be a site where you can insert different stat priorities from the game World Of Warcraft,
and then from those "weights" will calculate which items or dungeons you should focus on, we also plan to implement
that you can check according to you'r own character in the game, but thats a nice to have, the plan is to use external apis and our own,
the plan is when we load the site we fetch the required data from Blizzards api and manipulate the data and throw it in our own database

### Entities

1. Dungeon
2. Item

### Components

1. Header
2. Logo
3. ClassSpec
4. StatPrior
5. DungeonRaidSelect
6. GearSelect
7. Result
8. Dungeon
9. Item

### Endpoints
We will use blizzards Dungeon Journal api to fetch all the dungeons and items.
Then we will sort the dungeons so its only the ones that we need

then we will use
* api/dungeons
* api/items
